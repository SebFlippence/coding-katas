# Roman Numerals Coding Kata

The purpose of this exercise is not simply to solve the problem; instead, we are interested in how you approach the problem.

Please develop this as you would a piece of production code, with all the functional and non-functional considerations that implies. We are particularly interested in the following:

* Testing
* Performance
* Maintainability

## The problem

We need to write a JavaScript function that converts a number into a Roman Numeral.

```
function romanNumeralGenerator (int) {
}
```

For example, see the following sample inputs and outputs:

```
1 = "I"
5 = "V"
10 = "X"
20 = "XX"
3999 = "MMMCMXCIX"
```

**Caveat:** Only support numbers between 1 and 3999
